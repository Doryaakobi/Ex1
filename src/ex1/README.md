# Ex1 OOP

This assignment is the second part of the OOP course. In this assignment we deal with algorithms related to weighted and undirected graph. 
The various methods to explore the graph such as:

- Checking if the the graph is fully connected (meaning there's no more than one component.
- Exploring the graph for the shortest path between two vertices.  
   


# Classes & Interfaces

## Interfaces: 
- node_info
- weighted_graph
- weighted_grpah_algorithms
## Classes:
- WGraph_DS - this class implements the weighted_graph interface as well as the node_info interface a an inner class.
- WGraph_Algo - implements the weighted_graph_algorithms.
